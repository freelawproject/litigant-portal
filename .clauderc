# Git Commit Guidelines

When creating git commits (whether autonomously or user-prompted):

## Format Requirements
- ALWAYS use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope?): description`
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Commits MUST follow this format - there is a git hook at ~/.git-hooks/commit-msg that enforces it

## Commit Organization
- Create commits in LOGICAL CHUNKS - group related changes together
- Each commit should represent a single, coherent change
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit
- Never batch multiple unrelated features/fixes into one commit

## Examples
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer error`
- `docs: update README with setup instructions`
- `refactor(ui): simplify component structure`
- `build(deps): upgrade react to v18`
- `build: add nginx proxy and ngrok setup for mobile testing`

## Multi-line Commits
For commits with additional context, use multiple -m flags:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication" -m "Implements JWT-based auth with refresh tokens" -m "Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Workflow
1. Review all changes with `git status` and `git diff`
2. Group changes into logical commits
3. Stage each group separately with `git add`
4. Create commit with proper Conventional Commits format
5. Verify commit was accepted (hook will reject improper format)

The git hook will REJECT any commits that don't follow this format.
