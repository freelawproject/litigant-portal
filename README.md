# Litigant Portal

An open-source web application to democratize access to justice by empowering self-represented litigants with AI-augmented legal guidance, education, and document preparation tools.

Built by [Free Law Project](https://free.law) for use with CourtListener.com.

## Vision

To ensure that lack of financial resources never prevents anyone from understanding and exercising their legal rights.

See [VISION.md](./VISION.md) for our complete vision and mission statement.

## Tech Stack

Modern, type-safe web stack following best practices:

- **Backend**: Django 5.2+ with django-cotton components
- **Frontend**: AlpineJS (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Hot Module Replacement
- **Testing**: pytest (Python) + Vitest (TypeScript)
- **Code Quality**: Ruff + mypy (Python), ESLint + Prettier (TypeScript)

See [TECH_STACK.md](./TECH_STACK.md) for technical decisions and architecture.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.13+, uv, fnm (for Node.js)

# Install Node.js (uses .node-version file)
fnm install

# Setup Python environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
make install
make migrate

# Start development
make dev
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
make test              # All tests
make test-py          # Python only
make test-js          # TypeScript only

# Code quality

## Architecture

This project uses a **CSP-compliant architecture** following patterns from [CourtListener](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener):

- **Django Cotton** - Reusable component system
- **AlpineJS** - Lightweight reactivity (no inline scripts)
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe frontend code
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Vite** - Modern build pipeline

See [docs/CourtListener-Frontend-Architecture.md](./docs/CourtListener-Frontend-Architecture.md) for detailed patterns.
