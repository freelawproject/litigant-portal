**Jane Martin**: Single mom (2 kids, ages 6 & 8), ~$50k income, DuPage County IL, facing eviction.

---

## The Flow (Revised)

### Step 1: Jane Arrives

**Jane:** Opens portal

**AI/UI:** County detected from your location (DuPage County)

_Shows the magic - explains how we know_

---

### Step 2: "I got eviction papers"

**Jane:** "I got eviction papers"

**AI:** "I'm sorry to hear that. What type of notice does it say at the top? It might say something like '5-day notice' or '30-day notice'."

_One question at a time - doesn't overwhelm_

---

### Step 2b: Jane answers about paper type

**Jane:** "It says 5-day notice"

**AI:** "Thanks - a 5-day notice means your landlord is claiming unpaid rent and you have 5 days to pay or they can file for eviction. Can you tell me why they say you owe money? Sometimes the paperwork explains this."

_Confirms understanding, asks natural follow-up, lets paperwork do the work_

---

### Step 3: Jane explains her situation

**Jane:** "I've been paying for repairs the landlord won't fix - mold in the bathroom - so I deducted it from rent"

**AI:** "I understand. So you've been withholding rent because of repair issues. That's actually relevant - Illinois has tenant protections around habitability. Before we go further, can I ask about your household? This helps me find resources you might qualify for."

- **Sidebar:** Adds "Habitability defense - research"

_Acknowledges, shows why it matters, transitions naturally_

---

### Step 4: Context gathering

**Jane:** "It's me and my 2 kids"

**AI:** "Got it - a household of 3. Based on that, you may qualify for the Illinois Rental Payment Program. I'm adding that to your action items."

- **Sidebar:** Adds ILRPP application deadline

_Shows the work - explains WHY she qualifies_

---

### Step 5: Child support (rephrased per lawyer feedback)

**AI:** "You mentioned you have 2 children. Do you receive child support from their other parent?"

**Jane:** "My ex is supposed to pay but doesn't consistently"

**AI:** "That's important. Unpaid child support can be enforced, and getting that stabilized could help prevent situations like this in the future. I'm adding some resources about that."

- **Sidebar:** Adds child support enforcement resources

_Natural phrasing, connects the dots for her_

---

### Step 6: Filing requirements

**AI:** "For a 5-day notice in DuPage County, you'll want to file a written response called an 'appearance' before your court date. This tells the court you plan to contest the eviction. I'm adding this deadline to your action items."

- **Sidebar:** Adds appearance filing deadline

_Critical legal step - per lawyer feedback_

---

### Step 7: Court prep

**Jane:** "What should I bring to court?"

**AI:** Provides Wheaton courthouse logistics:

- 18th Judicial Circuit address, parking info
- Security procedures, dress recommendations
- Documents to bring: lease, repair receipts, payment history, photos of mold

- **Sidebar:** Adds court prep checklist

---

### Step 8: What happens after

**Jane:** "What happens after?"

**AI:** Explains post-judgment options, appeal timeline, follow-up steps

- **Sidebar:** Adds post-court next steps

---

## The Magic Moments

- AI **identifies filing requirements** she might have missed (appearance)
- AI **provides practical details** she couldn't know (parking, dress code)
- Sidebar **tracks everything** so nothing falls through the cracks
