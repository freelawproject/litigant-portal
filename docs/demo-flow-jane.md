# Jane's Journey - ITC Demo Flow

**Jane Martin**: Single mom (2 kids, ages 6 & 8), ~$50k income, DuPage County IL, facing eviction.

## The Flow

1. **Jane arrives** → Opens portal, county pre-selected (DuPage)

2. **"I got eviction papers"** → AI asks about timeline, landlord issues, family situation

3. **Jane shares context** → "2 kids, $50k income, landlord won't fix mold, I've been paying for repairs"
   - AI surfaces: habitability defense, ILRPP eligibility (income + family size qualifies)
   - Sidebar: adds ILRPP application deadline

4. **"Court date conflicts with work"** → AI explains mediation program, time-off rights under IL law
   - Sidebar: adds court date, mediation option

5. **AI asks follow-up** → "Is there anything affecting your financial situation, like child support?"
   - Jane: "My ex doesn't pay consistently"
   - AI connects: child support enforcement could help stabilize finances, prevent future housing issues
   - Sidebar: adds child support resources

6. **"What should I bring to court?"** → AI provides Wheaton courthouse logistics:
   - Address, parking, security
   - Dress recommendations
   - Documents to bring (lease, repair receipts, payment history)
   - Sidebar: adds court prep checklist

7. **"What happens after?"** → AI explains post-judgment options, appeal timeline, follow-up steps

## The Magic Moments

- AI **proactively connects** child support to eviction (holistic help)
- AI **surfaces eligibility** Jane didn't know about (ILRPP)
- AI **provides practical details** she couldn't know (parking, dress code)
- Sidebar **tracks everything** so nothing falls through the cracks

## Key Constraint

All information, no legal advice (UPL compliance).
