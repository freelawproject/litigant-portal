    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">What is eviction?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Eviction is the legal process a landlord uses to remove a tenant from a rental property.
      A landlord cannot simply change the locks or shut off utilities — they must go through the courts.
      Understanding how the process works helps you protect your rights whether you are a tenant or a landlord.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Common reasons for eviction</h2>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>Non-payment of rent</li>
      <li>Lease violations (unauthorized pets, subletting, property damage)</li>
      <li>Staying after the lease expires (holdover)</li>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">The eviction process</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      While details vary by state and local law, eviction typically follows these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>
        <strong>Written notice</strong> — The landlord serves a notice to cure or quit (pay rent, fix the violation, or vacate).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Court filing</strong> — If the issue is not resolved, the landlord files an eviction lawsuit (often called an "unlawful detainer").
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hearing</strong> — Both sides present their case to a judge. The tenant has the right to appear and respond.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Judgment</strong> — The court decides whether the tenant must leave and whether any money is owed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enforcement</strong> — If the tenant does not leave voluntarily, the landlord can request a court order for removal by a sheriff or marshal.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Tenant rights and defenses</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">Tenants have important legal protections during the eviction process:</p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>
        <strong>Proper notice</strong> — The landlord must give written notice with the correct number of days required by state law.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Habitability</strong> — Landlords must maintain safe and livable conditions. Failing to make essential repairs can be a defense.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retaliation</strong> — Landlords cannot evict tenants for reporting code violations, requesting repairs, or exercising other legal rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Discrimination</strong> — The Fair Housing Act prohibits evictions based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial status.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to respond</strong> — Tenants can file an answer with the court and present their side at the hearing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Landlord obligations</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">Landlords have legal responsibilities they must follow:</p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>Maintain the property in habitable condition (working plumbing, heat, structural integrity)</li>
      <li>Follow all notice requirements and court procedures</li>
      <li>Comply with the Fair Housing Act and local anti-discrimination laws</li>
      <li>Return security deposits according to state timelines and rules</li>
      <li>Never use "self-help" eviction (changing locks, removing belongings, shutting off utilities)</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">What to do if you receive an eviction notice</h2>
    <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>Read the notice carefully — note the deadline and reason.</li>
      <li>Do not ignore it — missing a court date usually results in a default judgment against you.</li>
      <li>
        Gather documentation — lease, rent receipts, photos, repair requests, and any written communication with your landlord.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider your options — you may be able to pay overdue rent, negotiate with the landlord, or raise a legal defense in court.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seek help — legal aid organizations, tenant rights groups, and court self-help centers can provide free assistance.
      </li>
    </ol>
