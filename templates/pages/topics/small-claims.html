    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">What is small claims court?</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Small claims court is a simplified court designed for resolving disputes involving relatively small amounts of money.
      The procedures are informal, lawyers are often not required (and sometimes not allowed), and cases are decided quickly &mdash; usually in a single hearing.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">The dollar limit varies by state, typically ranging from $2,500 to $25,000.</p>
