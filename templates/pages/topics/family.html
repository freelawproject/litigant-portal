    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Types of family law cases</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">

    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>Divorce and legal separation</li>
      <li>Child custody and visitation</li>
      <li>Child support and spousal support (alimony)</li>
      <li>Paternity establishment</li>
      <li>Adoption and guardianship</li>
      <li>Domestic violence protection orders</li>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">The divorce process</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Divorce ends a marriage through a court order. The process and requirements vary by state, but there are two main types:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>
        <strong>Uncontested divorce</strong> — Both spouses agree on major issues (property division, custody, support). This is typically faster, less expensive, and less stressful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contested divorce</strong> — The spouses disagree on one or more issues. A judge will make decisions after both sides present their case.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Many courts encourage or require <strong>mediation</strong> before trial. A neutral mediator helps both parties negotiate an agreement without going before a judge.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Child custody</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Custody decisions are based on the <strong>best interests of the child</strong> — the standard courts use in every state. Both parents' perspectives matter:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>
        <strong>Legal custody</strong> — The right to make major decisions about the child's education, health care, and religious upbringing. Can be sole or joint.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Physical custody</strong> — Where the child lives. Joint physical custody means the child spends significant time with both parents.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Courts consider factors like each parent's relationship with the child, stability of each home, the child's preferences (if old enough), and each parent's willingness to support the child's relationship with the other parent.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Child support</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
      Both parents have a legal obligation to support their children financially. Key points:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
      <li>
        <strong>Calculation</strong> — Most states use a formula based on both parents' incomes, the number of children, and the custody arrangement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modification</strong> — Support can be changed if circumstances significantly change (job loss, income increase, change in custody).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enforcement</strong> — Failure to pay can result in wage garnishment, tax refund interception, license suspension, or contempt of court.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Preparing for family court</h2>
    <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
