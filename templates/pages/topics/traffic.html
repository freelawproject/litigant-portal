        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-greyscale-700">
          <li><strong>Infractions</strong> &mdash; Minor violations like speeding, running a stop sign, or expired registration. Usually result in a fine and points on your license.</li>
          <li><strong>Misdemeanors</strong> &mdash; More serious offenses like reckless driving, driving on a suspended license, or hit-and-run (property damage only). Can carry fines, jail time, or both.</li>
          <li><strong>Felonies</strong> &mdash; The most serious traffic offenses, such as vehicular manslaughter or repeat DUI. Carry significant penalties including prison time.</li>

        <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
          When you receive a traffic citation, you generally have three options:
        </p>
        <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-greyscale-700">
          <li><strong>Pay the fine</strong> &mdash; This is an admission of guilt. The violation goes on your driving record and may increase your insurance rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Contest the ticket</strong> &mdash; Request a court hearing to challenge the citation. You'll need to present a defense to the judge.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic school</strong> &mdash; If eligible, completing traffic school may keep the violation off your record or reduce points. Eligibility varies by state and violation type.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Contesting a traffic ticket</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
          If you decide to fight the ticket:
        </p>
        <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
          <li>Enter a "not guilty" plea by the deadline on your ticket.</li>
          <li>Request any available evidence &mdash; radar calibration records, officer's notes, camera footage.</li>
          <li>Prepare your defense &mdash; photos of the location, witness statements, or evidence of equipment malfunction.</li>
          <li>Appear at the hearing on time and dressed respectfully.</li>
          <li>Present your case clearly. The government must prove the violation &mdash; you can challenge their evidence.</li>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">License suspension and reinstatement</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
          Your license can be suspended for various reasons:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
          <li>Accumulating too many points from traffic violations</li>
          <li>DUI/DWI conviction</li>
          <li>Failure to pay traffic fines or appear in court</li>
          <li>Failure to maintain auto insurance</li>
          <li>Failure to pay child support</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
          To reinstate a suspended license, you typically need to resolve the underlying issue (pay fines, complete a DUI program, provide proof of insurance), pay a reinstatement fee, and wait out any mandatory suspension period.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Fines and payment plans</h2>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
          <li>Fines vary widely depending on the violation and jurisdiction.</li>
          <li>Additional fees (court costs, surcharges) can significantly increase the total amount owed.</li>
          <li>Many courts offer payment plans if you cannot pay the full amount at once.</li>
          <li>If you cannot afford the fine, ask the court about community service alternatives or a fee waiver.</li>
          <li>Ignoring fines can lead to license suspension, additional penalties, and even a warrant for your arrest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-greyscale-900">Traffic school</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-greyscale-700">
          Traffic school (also called defensive driving) can help keep your record clean:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-greyscale-700">
          <li>Eligibility depends on your state, the type of violation, and your recent driving record.</li>
          <li>Courses are available online or in-person and typically take 4&ndash;8 hours.</li>
          <li>Completing the course may dismiss the ticket, reduce points, or lower your insurance increase.</li>
          <li>Make sure the course is approved by your state's DMV or traffic court.</li>
