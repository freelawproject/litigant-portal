# Litigant Portal - Vision & Mission

## Vision Statement

[DRAFT - To be refined]

To democratize access to justice by empowering self-represented litigants and underserved populations with AI-augmented legal guidance, education, and document preparation tools - ensuring that lack of financial resources never prevents anyone from understanding and exercising their legal rights.

## Core Principles

### Global by Design

-   Built with internationalization (i18n) at the foundation, not as an afterthought
-   WCAG accessibility compliance as a requirement, not a feature
-   Designed to start locally but scale globally across jurisdictions and legal systems

### Human-Centered AI

-   Technology augments and assists human expertise and care
-   AI guides users through complex legal processes with empathy and clarity
-   Transparency in how AI provides guidance and its limitations

### Equity & Access

-   No one denied access based on finances, ability, language, or technical literacy
-   Mobile-first to reach users where they are
-   Hybrid approach: conversational AI within guided workflows

## Initial Scope & Focus

### Target Timeline

~3 months to working prototype, MVP ~6 months

### Geographic & Legal Focus

Starting broad within a single jurisdiction to understand court systems holistically. Focus is civil court. Criminal court provides right to an attorney, but not so in Civil court. Initial pilot testing will likely focus on a few specific legal issues.

### User Interaction Model

Hybrid approach combining:

-   Guided workflows and step-by-step processes
-   Conversational AI assistance available throughout
-   Both chat interface and structured forms

### Technology Philosophy

Hybrid cloud/local approach supporting:

-   Privacy-first options with local model deployment (this needs expansion/exploration and education around cloud security vs local security. Cloud is scary for some situations) Cloud is capable of local deployment, security and management - it's not all just one shared 'bucket'.
-   Cloud APIs where appropriate for performance
-   Cost-conscious architecture to ensure sustainability
